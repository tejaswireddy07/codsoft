# Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction

## Objective
To build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger
survived the Titanic disaster based on demographic and travel information.

## Dataset
- Titanic-Dataset.csv
- Target column: Survived

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Steps Performed
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Feature selection
4. Model training using Logistic Regression
5. Model evaluation using accuracy and classification report

## Result
